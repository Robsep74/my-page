      <img src="../images/social-media-ad.png" width="300" alt="SocialMedia Ad">
      <p>This is an Advertisment for unbranded sneakers made with Photoshop.
        It is ideal for social media platforms and websites. I created it with a few different fonts,a background and the text is simmetrically
      balanced to avoid being overwhelming for the viewers and prospective customers. It also contains a button that can be linked to the order page.</p>
      <img src="../images/magazine-cover.png" width="300" alt="SocialMedia Ad">
      <p> This is a design for a magazine cover, and in a smiliar way, I can create brochures of any kind for printing and distribution. This magazine design is just an example,
        and it shows a few different fonts as well to keep it consistent, along with background colors and text fonts that can be mixed and are easy to ready. I used colors that can be combined
        and a magazine name that can also be easy to read, even if it's not a popular name. The small squares with numbers indicate the page number where the article can be found.</p>
      <img src="../images/facebook-ad.png" width="300" alt="SocialMedia Ad">
      <p>An advertisement to be posted on social media platforms. This is about Yoga Classes, so I used colors that have an element of peace and tranquility with soft color fonts
        and added my client's logo, as well as information about the event's place and time. The background has different blending options, and the brightness was reduced from the original image.
        it also emphasizes the color of the sun in the background. Additional and important social media info was added at the bottom to contrast the darker bottom of the image.</p>
      <img src="../images/dance-club_ad_full.gif" width="200" alt="SocialMedia Ad">
      <p>Another advertisment that can easily be used on websites and any other platform. This is an animated ad about a night club. It was made as an example, and it can be personalized 
        and also made in different ways with different fonts, colors, and backgrounds. In this case, it was made with a mix of colors that relate to nightlife.
        I used blue and red-pink to refer this as a place for different genres, which the image in the back also shows.</p>
